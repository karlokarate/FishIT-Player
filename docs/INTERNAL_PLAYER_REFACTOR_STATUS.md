# Internal Player Refactor - Integration Status

## Overview

This document tracks the integration of the refactored internal player modules from the ZIP file (`tools/tdlib neu.zip`) into the FishIT-Player repository.

## Date

2025-11-24

## What Was Integrated

### Successfully Integrated Modules

The following modules were successfully extracted from the ZIP and placed into their correct package locations:

#### Domain Layer (`com.chris.m3usuite.player.internal.domain`)
- ✅ **PlaybackContext.kt** - High-level domain context for playback sessions
  - Defines `PlaybackContext` data class with playback metadata
  - Defines `PlaybackType` enum (VOD, SERIES, LIVE)
  - Decoupled from ExoPlayer, TDLib, and UI concerns

- ✅ **ResumeManager.kt** - Resume position management abstraction
  - Interface for loading and saving resume positions
  - Supports VOD and series resume logic
  - Handles periodic ticks and playback completion

- ✅ **KidsPlaybackGate.kt** - Kids mode and screen time enforcement
  - Interface for evaluating playback start based on kid profiles
  - Tracks playback time and screen time limits
  - Returns `KidsGateState` for UI feedback

#### State Layer (`com.chris.m3usuite.player.internal.state`)
- ✅ **InternalPlayerState.kt** - Core UI state for the internal player
  - Defines `InternalPlayerUiState` with playback metadata
  - Includes `AspectRatioMode` enum
  - Defines `InternalPlayerController` interface for commands

#### Source Resolution (`com.chris.m3usuite.player.internal.source`)
- ✅ **InternalPlaybackSourceResolver.kt** - Playback source resolution
  - Resolves URLs, headers, and MIME types
  - Defines `ResolvedPlaybackSource` data class
  - Includes helper function `inferMimeTypeFromFileName`

### Not Integrated (Missing Dependencies)

The following modules from the ZIP could not be integrated because they depend on infrastructure that doesn't exist in the current codebase:

- ❌ **InternalPlayerScreen.kt** - Requires `RememberPlayerController` and other missing types
- ❌ **InternalPlayerSession.kt** - Requires `RememberPlayerController`, `attachPlayer`, and other missing APIs
- ❌ **InternalPlayerControls.kt** - Requires Material Icons that aren't imported (Replay10, Forward30, etc.)
- ❌ **InternalPlayerSystemUi.kt** - Requires missing string resources and Toast APIs
- ❌ **TelegramContentRepository.kt** - Major API changes that break existing call sites
- ❌ **TelegramDetailScreen.kt** - Incompatible with current implementation
- ❌ **StreamingConfig.kt** - Different from existing version
- ❌ **T_TelegramFileDownloader.kt** - Different from existing version
- ❌ **RarDataSource.kt** - Major changes not compatible with current usage
- ❌ **ObxEntities.kt** - Only contains ObxTelegramMessage, missing other entities

### Documentation
- ✅ **InternalPlayer_Refactor_Roadmap.md** - Copied to `docs/INTERNAL_PLAYER_REFACTOR_ROADMAP.md`

## Legacy Files

No files were marked as legacy because the new InternalPlayerScreen could not be integrated to replace the existing one.

The existing `InternalPlayerScreen.kt` (2568 lines) remains as the active implementation.

## Module Layout (Current State)

```
app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/
  InternalPlayerScreen.kt (existing - not replaced)
  
  internal/
    domain/
      PlaybackContext.kt ✅ NEW
      ResumeManager.kt ✅ NEW
      KidsPlaybackGate.kt ✅ NEW
    
    state/
      InternalPlayerState.kt ✅ NEW
    
    source/
      InternalPlaybackSourceResolver.kt ✅ NEW
```

## Build Status

✅ **Project builds successfully** with the integrated modules.

The new domain and state modules compile without errors and are ready to be used by future refactoring work.

## Next Steps (Future Work)

According to the refactor roadmap, the following phases remain:

1. **Phase 1 (Partial)** - PlaybackContext is integrated, but InternalPlayerScreen needs updating to accept it
2. **Phase 2 (Partial)** - ResumeManager and KidsPlaybackGate are integrated but not yet used
3. **Phase 3-10** - All remaining phases (Live-TV, Subtitles, PlayerSurface, TV controls, etc.)

### Prerequisites for Completing Integration

Before the remaining modules can be integrated, the codebase needs:

1. **RememberPlayerController** - A new player lifecycle management abstraction
2. **Material Icons** - Import missing icon resources (Replay10, Forward30, PlayArrow, Pause, etc.)
3. **String Resources** - Add missing string resources referenced by new UI modules
4. **API Evolution** - Update existing InternalPlayerScreen callers to use PlaybackContext

### Recommended Approach

1. Start using the integrated domain modules (PlaybackContext, ResumeManager, KidsPlaybackGate) in the existing InternalPlayerScreen
2. Gradually extract functionality from the monolithic InternalPlayerScreen into the new architecture
3. Add missing infrastructure (RememberPlayerController, icons, resources)
4. Once infrastructure exists, integrate the remaining modules from the ZIP

## Notes

- The ZIP file contains modules from an external development environment (ChatGPT project folder)
- These modules represent a future state of the refactor, not the current state
- The integration is designed to be non-breaking: all existing functionality continues to work
- The new modules provide the foundation for future refactoring work

## SIP Reference Modules Imported (Phase 2 Follow-up - 2025-11-24)

All remaining SIP modules from `tools/tdlib neu.zip` have been imported as reference implementations.

### Fully Integrated and Compilable Modules

**UI/System Layer:**
- ✅ **InternalPlayerControls.kt** - Player controls, dialogs (speed, tracks, debug), and overlays with fallback Material Icons
- ✅ **InternalPlayerSystemUi.kt** - System UI management (back handler, screen-on, fullscreen, PiP)

**Session Layer:**
- ✅ **InternalPlayerSession.kt** - Player lifecycle management, resume handling, kids gate integration
  - Note: Sleep timer and subtitle support commented out pending API availability

**Refactored Modules (with "Refactor" suffix to avoid conflicts):**
- ✅ **StreamingConfigRefactor.kt** - Streaming configuration object
- ✅ **T_TelegramFileDownloaderRefactor.kt** - File downloader with DownloadProgressRefactor type
- ✅ **RarDataSourceRefactor.kt** - RAR archive data source (implementation stubbed pending fileDownloader API)
- ✅ **ObxEntitiesRefactor.kt** - Refactored ObxTelegramMessage entity

**Infrastructure Stubs:**
- ✅ **RememberPlayerController.kt** - Stub interface for player lifecycle (TODO: Phase 7 implementation)
- ✅ **R.string.pip_not_available** - String resource for PiP unavailable message

### Reference-Only Modules (saved as .txt)

The following modules have extensive missing dependencies and are saved as .txt files for reference:

- 📄 **InternalPlayerScreenRefactor.kt.txt** - Modular screen orchestrator
  - Requires: FishM3uSuiteAppTheme, LocalWindowSize, playerSleepTimerMinutes
  
- 📄 **TelegramContentRepositoryRefactor.kt.txt** - Refactored Telegram content repository
  - Incompatible with current ObjectBox query API

### Build Status

✅ **Project builds successfully** (`./gradlew :app:assembleDebug`)

All compilable modules are integrated and the legacy monolithic InternalPlayerScreen.kt remains as the active runtime implementation. The SIP modules serve as reference implementations for future phases (3-10) of the refactor roadmap.

### Why This Was Done

> "All SIP modules from tools/tdlib neu.zip are now available in the repo as compilable reference implementations (or .txt for incompatible modules).
The old monolithic InternalPlayerScreen and associated streaming classes remain active for runtime.
This allows future phases (3-10) of the roadmap to progressively replace legacy behaviour with modular implementations without losing any functionality."

## Phase 1 Completed (2025-11-24)

### What Was Done

Phase 1 of the refactor roadmap has been completed. All call sites in the application now use `PlaybackContext` to describe playback sessions, while preserving existing runtime behavior.

**Bridge Entry Point Created:**
- `InternalPlayerEntry.kt` - A Phase 1 bridge function that:
  - Accepts the new typed `PlaybackContext` model
  - Maps `PlaybackType` enum to legacy string types ("vod", "series", "live")
  - Delegates to the monolithic legacy `InternalPlayerScreen` implementation
  - Preserves all existing runtime behavior

**Call Sites Updated:**

All internal player call sites now construct and pass `PlaybackContext`:

1. **MainActivity navigation composable** (`player?url=...` route)
   - Builds `PlaybackContext` based on type parameter
   - VOD: Uses `PlaybackType.VOD` with `mediaId`
   - SERIES: Uses `PlaybackType.SERIES` with `seriesId`, `season`, `episodeNumber`, `episodeId`
   - LIVE: Uses `PlaybackType.LIVE` with `mediaId`, `liveCategoryHint`, `liveProviderHint`

2. **LiveDetailScreen** (direct call)
   - Constructs `PlaybackContext` with `PlaybackType.LIVE` and category hints
   - Replaced direct `InternalPlayerScreen` call with `InternalPlayerEntry`

3. **SeriesDetailScreen** (fallback when `openInternal` is null)
   - Constructs `PlaybackContext` with `PlaybackType.SERIES`
   - Replaced direct `InternalPlayerScreen` call with `InternalPlayerEntry`
   - Note: Fallback path is missing some series context (by design in current implementation)

4. **VodDetailScreen, TelegramDetailScreen, SeriesDetailScreen** (via `openInternal` callbacks)
   - These screens use `openInternal` callbacks that navigate via route strings
   - The navigation is handled by the MainActivity composable (above)
   - Therefore all paths now use `PlaybackContext`

### Current Architecture

```
Call Sites (VOD/SERIES/LIVE/Telegram Detail Screens)
    ↓
InternalPlayerEntry (Phase 1 Bridge)
    ↓
InternalPlayerScreen (Legacy Monolithic Implementation)
```

### Build Status

✅ **Project builds successfully** with all Phase 1 changes

### What's Next

Phase 1 establishes the foundation for future refactor phases:

- **Phase 2**: ResumeManager and KidsPlaybackGate integration (already imported, ready to wire)
- **Phase 3-10**: Progressive replacement of legacy functionality with modular SIP implementations

The typed `PlaybackContext` at all call sites means future phases can switch to the modular SIP-based orchestrator without modifying call sites.

---

## Phase 1 Final Verification (2025-11-24)

**Phase 1 is fully complete.** All player call sites now use typed PlaybackContext and route through InternalPlayerEntry. The legacy monolithic InternalPlayerScreen remains the active runtime implementation. The SIP modules serve as the reference architecture for upcoming phases 2–10.

### Verification Summary

All internal player call sites across the entire repository have been verified:

1. **MainActivity Navigation** (`player?url=...` route) - Builds PlaybackContext from route parameters for VOD/SERIES/LIVE
2. **LiveDetailScreen** - Direct InternalPlayerEntry call with LIVE context
3. **SeriesDetailScreen** - Direct InternalPlayerEntry fallback with SERIES context
4. **VodDetailScreen** - Routes via openInternal lambda through MainActivity navigation
5. **TelegramDetailScreen** - Routes via openInternal lambda through MainActivity navigation
6. **LibraryScreen** - Routes via onOpenInternal lambda through MainActivity navigation
7. **StartScreen** - Routes via onOpenInternal lambda through MainActivity navigation

**No additional call sites found.** Every path to the internal player now uses the typed PlaybackContext model.

### Build Status

✅ **`./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` completes successfully** with no errors related to Phase 1 changes.

---

## Files Previously in ZIP (Now Integrated)

The following files have been extracted and integrated from `tools/tdlib neu.zip`:

- InternalPlayerScreen.kt
- InternalPlayerSession.kt
- InternalPlayerControls.kt
- InternalPlayerSystemUi.kt
- InternalPlayerSourceResolver.kt (duplicate of InternalPlaybackSourceResolver.kt)
- Updated versions of TelegramContentRepository, StreamingConfig, T_TelegramFileDownloader, RarDataSource
- Updated TelegramDetailScreen.kt
- Updated ObxEntities.kt (refactored ObxTelegramMessage)


These can serve as reference implementations for the corresponding future phases of the refactor.

---

## Phase 2 Preparation Started

- Integrated SIP domain modules for resume and kids gate.
- Added Phase2Stubs.kt as anchor point for upcoming integration.
- Legacy InternalPlayerScreen remains the active runtime implementation.
- No functional changes performed.

### SIP Modules Verified for Phase 2

The following modules are now in place and ready for Phase 2 integration:

**Domain Layer (`internal/domain/`):**
- `ResumeManager.kt` - Interface + `DefaultResumeManager` implementation
- `KidsPlaybackGate.kt` - Interface + `DefaultKidsPlaybackGate` implementation
- `PlaybackContext.kt` - Domain context for playback sessions

**State Layer (`internal/state/`):**
- `InternalPlayerState.kt` - Contains `InternalPlayerUiState`, `AspectRatioMode`, `InternalPlayerController`

**Session Layer (`internal/session/`):**
- `InternalPlayerSession.kt` - Session management with resume and kids gate support
- `Phase2Stubs.kt` - Anchor point for Phase 2 integration (NEW)

**Source Resolution (`internal/source/`):**
- `InternalPlaybackSourceResolver.kt` - URL resolution with `PlaybackSourceResolver` and `ResolvedPlaybackSource`

**UI/System Layers:**
- `internal/ui/InternalPlayerControls.kt` - Player controls reference
- `internal/system/InternalPlayerSystemUi.kt` - System UI management reference

### Phase 2 Status: 🔄 **PREPARATION COMPLETE**

All SIP modules for resume and kids gate are integrated, verified, and ready for use.
The `Phase2Stubs.kt` anchor file provides a stable integration point for upcoming work.
No runtime changes have been made - legacy `InternalPlayerScreen` remains the active implementation.

---

## Phase 2 – Resume & Kids Gate (Preparation Started)

- Verified that Phase 2 SIP abstractions (ResumeManager, KidsPlaybackGate, etc.) are imported and compile.
- Documented parity expectations between legacy InternalPlayerScreen behavior and modular implementations.
- Added Phase2Integration.kt as stable integration anchor for resume and kids logic.
- Legacy InternalPlayerScreen remains the active runtime implementation.
- No runtime behavior changes have been made yet.

### Legacy Behavior Mapping

The following legacy behaviors in `InternalPlayerScreen.kt` have been mapped to Phase 2 abstractions:

**Resume Handling:**
| Legacy Location | Legacy Behavior | Phase 2 Abstraction |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| L572-608 | Load resume position on start, seek if >10s | `ResumeManager.loadResumePositionMs()` |
| L692-722 | Save/clear resume every ~3s | `ResumeManager.handlePeriodicTick()` |
| L636-664 | Save/clear resume on ON_DESTROY | Future: `InternalPlayerLifecycle` (Phase 8) |
| L798-806 | Clear resume on STATE_ENDED | `ResumeManager.handleEnded()` |

**Kids/Screen-Time Gate:**
| Legacy Location | Legacy Behavior | Phase 2 Abstraction |
|-----------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| L547-569 | Check kid profile & remaining time on start | `KidsPlaybackGate.evaluateStart()` |
| L725-744 | Tick usage every ~60s, block if limit reached | `KidsPlaybackGate.onPlaybackTick()` |
| L2282-2290 | Show AlertDialog when blocked | `InternalPlayerUiState.kidBlocked` |

### Integration Anchor

`Phase2Integration.kt` provides stable integration hooks that mirror legacy behavior:
- `loadInitialResumePosition()` - Resume loading on playback start
- `onPlaybackTick()` - Periodic resume save and kids gate tick
- `onPlaybackEnded()` - Clear resume on playback completion
- `evaluateKidsGateOnStart()` - Kids gate evaluation before playback

These functions are NOT called from production code paths and serve as the integration anchor for future work that will gradually move logic from the legacy screen into the modular session.

---

## Phase 2 – Step 2 Completed

- Phase2Integration.kt now mirrors all legacy behavioral segments:
  - L547–569 (KidsGate start)
  - L572–608 (Resume start)
  - L692–722 (Resume tick)
  - L725–744 (Kids tick)
  - L798–806 (Playback end)
- ResumeManager and KidsPlaybackGate contain full parity TODOs for future migration.
- No runtime behavior modified.
- All SIP modules remain reference-only.

### Detailed Behavioral Mapping in Phase2Integration.kt

Each integration function now includes:
- **Legacy Parameter Shape**: The exact parameters used by legacy InternalPlayerScreen
- **Modular Parameter Shape**: The equivalent PlaybackContext-based parameters
- **Behavioral Parity Notes**: Line-by-line correspondence to legacy code
- **Threshold Rules**: Exact threshold values (e.g., >10s for resume, <10s for near-end clear)
- **Timing Contracts**: Expected call frequency (3s for ticks, 60s for kids gate)
- **Side Effects**: What UI or player state changes are expected

### Full Parity TODOs Added

**DefaultResumeManager TODOs:**
- `>10s rule`: Only restore resume positions greater than 10 seconds
- `<10s near-end clear`: Clear resume when remaining playback is less than 10 seconds
- `Multi-ID mapping`: VOD uses mediaId, SERIES uses composite key (seriesId+season+episodeNum)
- `Periodic tick timing contract (3s)`: Called every ~3 seconds during playback
- `Duration guard`: Skip save/clear when duration is unknown or invalid
- `STATE_ENDED clear`: Clear resume unconditionally on playback end

**DefaultKidsPlaybackGate TODOs:**
- `Profile detection`: currentProfileId.first() → ObxProfile lookup
- `Kid profile type check`: prof?.type == "kid"
- `Daily quota`: remainingMinutes() returns MINUTES for quota comparison
- `Block transitions`: kidBlocked = remain <= 0; player.playWhenReady = false
- `60-second accumulation`: Tick every 60 seconds, not every 3 seconds
- `Pause/Play event interactions`: Stop accumulation during pause
- `Fail-open exception handling`: Exceptions result in allow (kidActive = false)

### Verification

- ✅ `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` builds successfully
- ✅ Runtime flow unchanged: InternalPlayerEntry → legacy InternalPlayerScreen
- ✅ All SIP modules compile but are not executed at runtime

---

## Phase 2 – Modular Resume & Kids Gate Implemented (Not Wired)

**Date:** 2025-11-25

This phase implements the actual modular logic inside the SIP Phase 2 modules and their session integration, while keeping them unused in runtime (no changes to navigation or InternalPlayerEntry).

### What Was Done

**DefaultResumeManager Implementation (Mirrors Legacy Behavior):**

1. `loadResumePositionMs(playbackContext)` - Mirrors legacy L572-608:
   - Only restores if position > 10 seconds (legacy threshold)
   - Uses `mediaId` for VOD content
   - Uses composite series key (`seriesId` + `season` + `episodeNumber`) for SERIES content
   - Returns `null` for LIVE content
   - Returns `null` when no stored resume entry exists or stored position ≤ 10 seconds

2. `handlePeriodicTick(playbackContext, positionMs, durationMs)` - Mirrors legacy L692-722:
   - Assumes caller invokes at ~3s intervals (does not re-implement timing)
   - Saves resume position for VOD/SERIES
   - Clears resume when remaining duration < 10 seconds
   - No-op for LIVE content
   - Guards against invalid duration (duration ≤ 0)

3. `handleEnded(playbackContext)` - Mirrors legacy L798-806:
   - Clears resume for VOD/SERIES when playback fully ends (STATE_ENDED)
   - No-op for LIVE content

**DefaultKidsPlaybackGate Implementation (Mirrors Legacy Behavior):**

1. `evaluateStart()` - Mirrors legacy L547-569 "KidsGate start":
   - Looks up `currentProfileId` → `ObxProfile`
   - Determines `isKid` via `profile?.type == "kid"`
   - Initializes remaining daily quota based on `ScreenTimeRepository`
   - Fail-open behavior: On exceptions or missing profile, returns safe state (`kidActive = false`)

2. `onPlaybackTick(currentState, deltaSecs)` - Mirrors legacy L725-744:
   - Assumes caller passes exact `deltaSecs` intervals (e.g., 60 seconds)
   - Decrements remaining daily quota using `ScreenTimeRepository.tickUsageIfPlaying`
   - If quota ≤ 0: Returns state indicating kid playback must be blocked
   - Maintains block transitions parity: Once blocked, state remains blocked
   - Fail-open: Exceptions do not crash; returns safe state

**SIP InternalPlayerSession Integration:**

The SIP `InternalPlayerSession` already integrates both modules:
- Instantiates `DefaultResumeManager` and `DefaultKidsPlaybackGate` using existing dependencies
- On session start: Uses `Phase2Integration.loadInitialResumePosition` to determine initial seek position
- On periodic playback position updates (3s loop): Calls resume and kids gate tick handlers
- Updates `InternalPlayerUiState` fields: `kidActive`, `kidBlocked`, `kidProfileId`
- On playback end: Uses `resumeManager.handleEnded()` to clear resume

### New Unit Tests

Added `InternalPlayerSessionPhase2Test.kt` with comprehensive tests:

**ResumeManager Tests:**
- Does not resume when stored position ≤ 10 seconds
- Resumes when stored position > 10 seconds
- Returns null for LIVE content
- Clears resume when remaining duration < 10 seconds
- Saves resume when remaining duration ≥ 10 seconds
- Clears resume on playback ended
- Does not save when duration is invalid

**KidsPlaybackGate Tests:**
- Kid profile detection returns proper state
- Returns blocked state when quota exhausted
- 60-second accumulation triggers quota decrement
- Quota exhaustion leads to blocked state
- Non-kid profiles are not affected
- Blocked state persists

**Phase2Integration Tests:**
- `loadInitialResumePosition` delegates correctly
- `onPlaybackTick` handles both resume and kids gate
- `onPlaybackEnded` clears resume
- `evaluateKidsGateOnStart` delegates correctly

### Runtime Status

- ✅ Runtime path is unchanged: `InternalPlayerEntry` → legacy `InternalPlayerScreen`
- ✅ SIP session remains a non-runtime, future target for Phase 3+
- ✅ No functional changes to the production player flow
- ✅ All modular implementations are complete and tested

### Build & Test Status

- ✅ `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` builds successfully
- ✅ `./gradlew :app:test` passes all tests including new Phase 2 tests
- ✅ All SIP modules compile and are ready for future runtime wiring

### What's Next

Phase 2 modular implementation is complete. The following phases remain:

- **Phase 3+**: Actual runtime switchover from legacy `InternalPlayerScreen` to modular SIP-based architecture
- **Phase 7**: `RememberPlayerController` implementation
- **Phase 8**: Lifecycle management (`ON_DESTROY` save/clear)

The typed `PlaybackContext` at all call sites and the complete modular implementations mean future phases can switch to the SIP-based orchestrator without modifying call sites or re-implementing resume/kids logic.

---

## Phase 2 – Final Stabilization Completed

**Date:** 2025-11-25

This phase finalizes Phase 2 by stabilizing the modular session infrastructure and preparing it for Phase 3 activation.

### What Was Done

**SIP InternalPlayerSession Hardened with Defensive Guards:**

1. **Negative durationMs Guard:**
   - ResumeManager skips save/clear when durationMs <= 0
   - Matches legacy behavior that guards against unknown duration

2. **positionMs > durationMs Guard:**
   - Near-end logic uses remaining calculation which handles this case
   - Negative remaining treated as near-end (clears resume)

3. **Unknown/Malformed PlaybackContext Guards:**
   - Null mediaId for VOD: No-op (no crash)
   - Null seriesId/season/episodeNumber for SERIES: No-op
   - Guards at all entry points in ResumeManager and KidsPlaybackGate

4. **LIVE Playback Resume Guard:**
   - Explicit check in initial seek: `playbackContext.type == PlaybackType.LIVE → null`
   - ResumeManager returns null for LIVE type
   - No resume save/clear operations for LIVE content

**Extended InternalPlayerUiState Fields (Phase 3 Ready):**

| Field | Type | Phase 3 UI Consumption |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| `isResumingFromLegacy` | Boolean | Show "Resuming..." indicator during initial seek |
| `resumeStartMs` | Long? | Show toast "Resumed from X:XX" after seek completes |
| `remainingKidsMinutes` | Int? | Show countdown timer in controls for kid profiles |

**SIP-Only Integration Tests:**

New test file: `InternalPlayerSessionPhase2IntegrationTest.kt`

Tests verify:
- ResumeManager + KidsGate coordination through Phase2Integration
- SIP session correctly updates InternalPlayerUiState
- Blocking transitions do not affect runtime (no actual player)
- SIP session emits stable, predictable state for Phase 3
- Defensive guards for edge cases:
  - Negative durationMs
  - positionMs > durationMs
  - Null mediaId/seriesId
  - Null kidProfileId

**Inline Documentation Added:**

- Comprehensive phase activation roadmap in InternalPlayerSession
- Legacy behavior mirroring annotations for all modules
- Independence guarantees documentation (no ViewModel, Navigation, ObjectBox, or legacy state dependencies)

### Files Modified

1. `InternalPlayerSession.kt` - Added defensive guards and phase documentation
2. `InternalPlayerState.kt` - Extended with Phase 3 annotated fields
3. `InternalPlayerSessionPhase2IntegrationTest.kt` - New SIP-only integration tests

### Runtime Status

- ✅ Runtime path unchanged: `InternalPlayerEntry` → legacy `InternalPlayerScreen`
- ✅ SIP session remains non-runtime reference implementation
- ✅ No functional changes to production player flow
- ✅ Modular session is now verified and ready for Phase 3 activation work

### Build & Test Status

- ✅ `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` builds successfully
- ✅ `./gradlew :app:test` passes all tests including new Phase 2 integration tests
- ✅ All SIP modules compile and are internally consistent

### Phase 3 Readiness Checklist

- [x] SIP InternalPlayerSession hardened with defensive guards
- [x] Extended modular InternalPlayerUiState fields for future UI phases
- [x] SIP-only integration tests implemented
- [x] Legacy behavior mapping fully documented
- [x] Independence from ViewModels, Navigation, ObjectBox verified
- [x] Stable, predictable state emission for Phase 3 UI modules

## Phase 3 – Shadow Mode Initialization Started

**Date:** 2025-11-25

This phase initiates shadow-mode activation of the modular SIP session, running it in parallel with the legacy player for verification and diagnostics.

### What Was Done

**1. Created InternalPlayerShadow Bridge (`internal/bridge/InternalPlayerShadow.kt`):**

The shadow-mode entry point allows the modular session to be invoked in observation mode:
- `startShadowSession(...)` - Starts shadow session without controlling playback
- `stopShadowSession()` - Cleans up shadow session resources
- `ShadowSessionState` - Data class for shadow state diagnostics

**Shadow Mode Principles:**
- Never controls real ExoPlayer instance
- Never modifies legacy screen state
- Never interrupts or affects user playback experience
- State is captured for diagnostics only

**2. Extended InternalPlayerUiState with Shadow-Mode Fields:**

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `shadowActive` | Boolean | Indicates if shadow observation is active |
| `shadowStateDebug` | String? | Debug string for overlay diagnostics |

**Field Documentation:**
- Not consumed by runtime UI
- Used for Phase 3–4 overlay debugging and verification
- Can be toggled via developer settings (future)

**3. Added SIP-Only Shadow-Mode Tests (`InternalPlayerSessionPhase3ShadowTest.kt`):**

Comprehensive tests verify:

**Shadow Session Safety:**
- Modular session can start without UI, navigation, ObjectBox, or ExoPlayer
- Shadow session never throws even with:
  - Missing mediaItem
  - Null seriesId
  - Negative durations
  - Invalid PlaybackContext combinations

**Clean Shutdown:**
- Shadow session stops cleanly without affecting legacy behavior
- Stop is safe to call multiple times
- Stop is safe to call without prior start

**State Independence:**
- UI state shadow fields have stable defaults
- Shadow fields can be set independently
- Copy preserves shadow fields
- Shadow fields do not affect legacy fields

**Integration with Phase2 Modules:**
- Phase2Integration works with shadow fakes
- ResumeManager and KidsPlaybackGate work in shadow mode

### Runtime Status

- ✅ Runtime path unchanged: `InternalPlayerEntry` → legacy `InternalPlayerScreen`
- ✅ Shadow entry point defined but NOT called by runtime code
- ✅ Legacy player remains the active orchestrator
- ✅ No functional changes to production player flow

### Files Added/Modified

**New Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/bridge/InternalPlayerShadow.kt`
- `app/src/test/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/session/InternalPlayerSessionPhase3ShadowTest.kt`

**Modified Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/state/InternalPlayerState.kt` - Added shadow fields
- `docs/INTERNAL_PLAYER_REFACTOR_STATUS.md` - This documentation

### What's Next (Phase 3 Remaining Work)

Phase 3 is NOT complete. Remaining tasks:

- [ ] Implement shadow session internals (currently placeholder)
- [ ] Wire shadow session to observe real playback inputs
- [ ] Add diagnostics logging for shadow state
- [ ] Create verification workflow to compare modular vs legacy behavior
- [ ] Add developer toggle for shadow mode activation

### Architecture After Phase 3 Initialization

```
Call Sites (VOD/SERIES/LIVE/Telegram Detail Screens)
    ↓
InternalPlayerEntry (Phase 1 Bridge)
    ↓
InternalPlayerScreen (Legacy - ACTIVE)
    ↓ (future: shadow observation)
InternalPlayerShadow (Shadow - PASSIVE, NOT WIRED YET)
    ↓
InternalPlayerSession (SIP - NOT CONTROLLING PLAYBACK)
```

---

## Phase 3 – Step 2: Legacy↔Shadow Parity Comparison Implemented

**Date:** 2025-11-25

This step implements the comparison pipeline between legacy and shadow state for diagnostics-only verification.

### What Was Done

**1. Created ShadowComparisonService (`internal/shadow/ShadowComparisonService.kt`):**

A diagnostics-only service for comparing legacy and shadow state:
- `compare(legacy, shadow)` - Compares two `InternalPlayerUiState` instances
- Returns `ComparisonResult` with parity flags and position offset

**ComparisonResult fields:**
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `resumeParityOk` | Boolean | True if both states have same resumeStartMs |
| `kidsGateParityOk` | Boolean | True if both states have same kidBlocked status |
| `positionOffsetMs` | Long? | Difference between legacy and shadow position (null if unavailable) |
| `flags` | List<String> | Diagnostic flags: "resumeMismatch", "kidsGateMismatch" |

**2. Added Comparison Callback to InternalPlayerShadow:**

Extended `startShadowSession(...)` with new parameter:
```kotlin
onShadowComparison: ((ShadowComparisonService.ComparisonResult) -> Unit)? = null
```

Added utility function:
```kotlin
fun invokeComparison(
    legacyState: InternalPlayerUiState,
    shadowState: InternalPlayerUiState,
    callback: ((ShadowComparisonService.ComparisonResult) -> Unit)?
)
```

**3. Extended InternalPlayerUiState with Comparison Fields:**

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `currentPositionMs` | Long? | Current position for parity comparison (separate from runtime positionMs) |
| `comparisonDurationMs` | Long? | Duration for parity comparison (separate from runtime durationMs) |

**Documentation in InternalPlayerState.kt:**
```
These fields exist to enable parity comparison between
legacy and shadow sessions (Phase 3–4).
They MUST NOT drive any runtime UI behavior yet.
```

**4. Added Dedicated Tests (`InternalPlayerShadowComparisonTest.kt`):**

Comprehensive tests verify:
- Resume parity detection (matching, null, mismatch cases)
- Kids-gate parity detection (blocked/unblocked cases)
- Position offset calculation (positive, negative, zero, null cases)
- ComparisonResult flags (empty, single, multiple)
- Callback invocation (with/without callback, matching/mismatching states)
- No runtime path impact (state immutability, placeholder behavior)
- InternalPlayerUiState comparison fields (defaults, independence, copy preservation)

## Phase 3 – Step 3: Controls Shadow Mode Activated

**Date:** 2025-11-25

This step adds modular SIP InternalPlayerControls shadow-mode diagnostics without affecting runtime behavior.

### What Was Done

**1. Created InternalPlayerControlsShadow (`internal/shadow/InternalPlayerControlsShadow.kt`):**

A diagnostics-only wrapper that mirrors all public behaviors from InternalPlayerControls:

| Control Behavior | Diagnostic Emitted |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Playback state | `playback state: playing=true, buffering=false` |
| Trickplay/speed | `trickplay active: speed=+2.0x` or `trickplay: inactive (normal speed)` |
| Aspect ratio | `aspectRatioMode: FIT` |
| Seek position | `position: 12000ms / 60000ms` |
| Seek preview | `seekPreview requested at 45000ms` |
| Loop mode | `loop mode: enabled` |
| Subtitle menu | `subtitle/tracks menu: opened` |
| Speed dialog | `speed dialog: opened` |
| Settings dialog | `settings dialog: opened` |
| Debug overlay | `debug overlay: visible` |
| Sleep timer | `sleep timer active: 300000ms remaining` |
| Kids gate | `kids gate: active, profileId=123, blocked=false, remaining=15min` |
| Resume state | `resuming from: 45000ms` |
| Errors | `playback error: <message>` |

**Safety Guarantees:**
- Never modifies InternalPlayerUiState
- Never interacts with any UI component
- Never affects ExoPlayer or legacy player
- Safe to call with null/empty/invalid state fields
- Never throws exceptions (fail-safe with catch-all)

**2. Extended InternalPlayerShadow with Controls Callback:**

Added new callback parameter to `startShadowSession()`:
```kotlin
onShadowControlsDiagnostic: ((String) -> Unit)? = null
```

Added utility function:
```kotlin
fun evaluateControlsInShadowMode(
    shadowState: InternalPlayerUiState,
    callback: ((String) -> Unit)?
)
```

**3. Added Comprehensive Test Suite (`InternalPlayerControlsShadowTest.kt`):**

Test categories:

**Safety/Edge Case Tests (Must Never Throw):**
- Default state
- Null callback
- Default aspectRatioMode
- Missing subtitle flags
- Impossible trickplay combination (zero speed)
- Negative speed
- All null optional fields
- Extreme values (Long.MAX_VALUE, Float.MAX_VALUE)

**Diagnostic String Emission Tests:**
- Playback state (playing, buffering)
- Trickplay (fast-forward, slow-motion, normal)
- Aspect ratio (all modes)
- Position
- Seek preview
- Subtitle/tracks menu
- Speed dialog
- Settings dialog
- Loop mode
- Debug overlay
- Sleep timer
- Kids gate (active, blocked)
- Resume state

**No Modification/Immutability Tests:**
- UiState remains unchanged after evaluation

**InternalPlayerShadow Integration Tests:**
- evaluateControlsInShadowMode works correctly
- Safe with null callback
- startShadowSession accepts onShadowControlsDiagnostic parameter

**No Linkage to UI Tests:**
- Does not require Android Context
- Works without Composable context
- Pure function with no side effects

### Files Added/Modified

**New Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/shadow/InternalPlayerControlsShadow.kt`
- `app/src/test/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/shadow/InternalPlayerControlsShadowTest.kt`

**Modified Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/bridge/InternalPlayerShadow.kt` - Added controls callback and utility
- `docs/INTERNAL_PLAYER_REFACTOR_STATUS.md` - This documentation

### Runtime Status

- ✅ Runtime path unchanged: `InternalPlayerEntry` → legacy `InternalPlayerScreen`
- ✅ Controls shadow is diagnostics-only (never affects playback)
- ✅ Shadow pipeline now evaluates Session + Controls without affecting runtime
- ✅ No functional changes to production player flow

### Build & Test Status

- ✅ `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` builds successfully
- ✅ `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` passes all tests including new controls shadow tests

## Phase 3 – Step 4: Spec-Driven Diagnostics

**Date:** 2025-11-25

This step implements spec-driven shadow diagnostics, evaluating SIP and Legacy behavior strictly against the Behavior Contract rather than treating Legacy as the gold standard.

### What Was Done

**1. Updated ShadowComparisonService with Spec-Driven Three-Way Comparison:**

The comparison service now performs:
1. SIP state vs Spec (Behavior Contract)
2. Legacy state vs Spec (Behavior Contract)
3. SIP vs Legacy (for context only)

**New Types Added:**

```kotlin
enum class ParityKind {
    ExactMatch,          // SIP == Spec AND Legacy == Spec
    SpecPreferredSIP,    // SIP == Spec, Legacy violates Spec
    SpecPreferredLegacy, // Legacy == Spec, SIP violates Spec
    BothViolateSpec,     // both are wrong
    DontCare             // divergence allowed by spec
}

data class SpecComparisonResult(
    val parityKind: ParityKind,
    val dimension: String,        // "resume", "kids", "position", etc.
    val legacyValue: Any?,
    val sipValue: Any?,
    val specDetails: String,
    val flags: List<String> = emptyList()
)
```

**Spec Rules Implemented (from INTERNAL_PLAYER_BEHAVIOR_CONTRACT.md):**

| Dimension | Spec Rule | Section |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| Resume | Only restore if position > 10 seconds | 3.3 |
| Resume | Clear resume when remaining < 10 seconds | 3.4 |
| Resume | LIVE content never resumes | 3.1 |
| Kids Gate | Block when quota <= 0 | 4.3 |
| Position | Drift within 1s tolerance is DontCare | Tolerated variance |

**2. Integrated Spec-Based Comparison into InternalPlayerShadow:**

Added new callback and utility function:

```kotlin
// New callback parameter
onSpecComparison: ((ShadowComparisonService.SpecComparisonResult) -> Unit)? = null

// New utility function
fun invokeSpecComparison(
    legacyState: InternalPlayerUiState,
    sipState: InternalPlayerUiState,
    playbackContext: PlaybackContext,
    durationMs: Long? = null,
    callback: ((ShadowComparisonService.SpecComparisonResult) -> Unit)?
)
```

**3. Updated InternalPlayerControlsShadow with Spec-Oriented Diagnostics:**

Controls shadow now emits spec-validated diagnostics:

| Diagnostic | Spec Validation |
|------------|-----------------|
| Trickplay | `"trickplay violates spec (speed <= 0 not allowed)"` |
| Aspect Ratio | `"aspect ratio FIT is spec-preferred for most scenarios"` |
| Subtitle Menu | `"subtitle menu open matches spec"` |
| Resume | `"resume position violates spec (should be >10s)"` |
| Kids Gate | `"kids gate violates spec (should be blocked when quota <= 0)"` |

**4. Created ShadowDiagnosticsAggregator:**

New aggregator class for storing and forwarding shadow diagnostic events:

- `ShadowEvent.Kind.SpecComparison` - For spec comparison results
- `ShadowEvent.Kind.LegacyComparison` - For legacy parity results
- `ShadowEvent.Kind.ControlsDiagnostic` - For controls diagnostic strings

Features:
- Event storage for debugging/verification
- Filtered views by dimension and ParityKind
- Callback registration for downstream consumers
- Thread-safe event collection
- Fail-safe error handling

**5. Added Spec-Driven Tests (InternalPlayerShadowSpecComparisonTest.kt):**

Comprehensive test coverage for:

| Test Category | Coverage |
|--------------|----------|
| Resume Spec | ExactMatch, SpecPreferredSIP, SpecPreferredLegacy, BothViolateSpec |
| Resume LIVE | Never resumes rule validation |
| Kids Gate | Quota blocking rule validation |
| Position | Drift tolerance validation |
| Robustness | Null, malformed, extreme state handling |

Tests load rules from the Behavior Contract (embedded as constants in ShadowComparisonService).

### Key Principle

**Legacy behavior is NOT the source of truth. The Behavior Contract defines correctness.**

SIP is allowed to intentionally improve on legacy when the spec says so. Diagnostics classify differences as:
- `SpecPreferredSIP`: SIP fixes a legacy bug
- `SpecPreferredLegacy`: SIP has a bug that legacy got right
- `ExactMatch`: Both comply with spec
- `BothViolateSpec`: Both need fixing
- `DontCare`: Allowed variance

### Files Added/Modified

**New Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/shadow/ShadowDiagnosticsAggregator.kt`
- `app/src/test/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/shadow/InternalPlayerShadowSpecComparisonTest.kt`

**Modified Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/shadow/ShadowComparisonService.kt` - Added spec-driven comparison
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/shadow/InternalPlayerControlsShadow.kt` - Added spec-oriented diagnostics
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/bridge/InternalPlayerShadow.kt` - Added spec comparison callback
- `docs/INTERNAL_PLAYER_REFACTOR_STATUS.md` - This documentation

### Runtime Status

- ✅ Runtime path unchanged: `InternalPlayerEntry` → legacy `InternalPlayerScreen`
- ✅ Shadow diagnostics operate strictly via the Behavior Contract
- ✅ Legacy is no longer treated as the reference
- ✅ SIP is judged solely against the contract and allowed to fix legacy bugs
- ✅ Every diagnostic output is classified using ParityKind
- ✅ No runtime flow is changed

### Build & Test Status

- ✅ `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` builds successfully
- ✅ `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` passes all tests including new spec comparison tests

## Phase 3 – LivePlaybackController Structural Foundation

**Date:** 2025-11-25

This section documents the implementation of the LivePlaybackController interface and core models as the structural foundation for Phase 3 live-TV functionality.

### What Was Done

**1. Created `internal/live` Package with Core Models:**

- **LiveChannel.kt** - Domain model for live TV channels:
  ```kotlin
  data class LiveChannel(
      val id: Long,
      val name: String,
      val url: String,
      val category: String?,
      val logoUrl: String?,
  )
  ```

- **EpgOverlayState.kt** - Domain model for EPG overlay state:
  ```kotlin
  data class EpgOverlayState(
      val visible: Boolean,
      val nowTitle: String?,
      val nextTitle: String?,
      val hideAtRealtimeMs: Long?,
  )
  ```

**2. Created LivePlaybackController Interface:**

Defines the contract for live TV playback behavior:
- `suspend fun initFromPlaybackContext(ctx: PlaybackContext)`
- `fun jumpChannel(delta: Int)`
- `fun selectChannel(channelId: Long)`
- `fun onPlaybackPositionChanged(positionMs: Long)`
- `val currentChannel: StateFlow<LiveChannel?>`
- `val epgOverlay: StateFlow<EpgOverlayState>`

**3. Created Supporting Interfaces:**

- **LiveChannelRepository** - Abstraction for live channel data access
- **LiveEpgRepository** - Abstraction for EPG (now/next) data access
- **TimeProvider** - Abstraction for clock operations (testability)
- **SystemTimeProvider** - Default implementation using System.currentTimeMillis()

**4. Created DefaultLivePlaybackController Stub Implementation:**

- StateFlows initialized with safe defaults (`currentChannel = null`, `epgOverlay.visible = false`)
- All methods contain TODO markers referencing "Phase 3 – Step 2"
- Full KDoc documenting Behavior Contract compliance:
  - LIVE playback never participates in resume
  - Kids gating handled by existing components
  - Controller remains domain-only (no Android/UI dependencies)

**5. Created LivePlaybackControllerTest:**

Test skeleton with:
- Fake implementations for all dependencies
- Initial state assertions (`currentChannel.value == null`, `epgOverlay.value.visible == false`)
- Data model property tests
- TimeProvider tests
- TODO-marked tests for Phase 3 – Step 2/3 (channel navigation, EPG auto-hide, integration)

### Files Added

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `internal/live/LiveChannel.kt` | Domain model for live channels |
| `internal/live/EpgOverlayState.kt` | Domain model for EPG overlay state |
| `internal/live/LivePlaybackController.kt` | Interface + repository abstractions + TimeProvider |
| `internal/live/DefaultLivePlaybackController.kt` | Stub implementation |
| `test/.../live/LivePlaybackControllerTest.kt` | Test skeleton |

### Runtime Status

- ✅ Runtime path unchanged: `InternalPlayerEntry` → legacy `InternalPlayerScreen`
- ✅ No legacy logic migrated yet
- ✅ No UI integration performed
- ✅ Pure structural foundation only
- ✅ All code compiles and tests pass

### Build & Test Status

- ✅ `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin` builds successfully
- ✅ `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "*.LivePlaybackControllerTest"` passes all tests

### Behavior Contract Compliance

As documented in the KDoc:

1. **LIVE playback never resumes** (INTERNAL_PLAYER_BEHAVIOR_CONTRACT.md Section 3.1)
   - LivePlaybackController does NOT integrate with ResumeManager
   - Resume is handled at session level where LIVE type is excluded

2. **Kids gating handled by existing components**
   - KidsPlaybackGate handles screen-time quota for all types including LIVE
   - LivePlaybackController does NOT re-implement kids gating

3. **LivePlaybackController is domain-only**
   - Pure Kotlin, no Android dependencies
   - State exposed via StateFlow for UI consumption
   - Composable and testable in isolation

### Phase 3 – Step 1 Complete

**PR #307** completed Phase 3 – Step 1: LivePlaybackController structural foundation.

**What was delivered:**
- ✅ `LivePlaybackController` interface with full contract documentation
- ✅ `LiveChannel` and `EpgOverlayState` domain models
- ✅ `DefaultLivePlaybackController` stub implementation with TODO markers
- ✅ `LiveChannelRepository` and `LiveEpgRepository` abstractions
- ✅ `TimeProvider` abstraction for testable time operations
- ✅ `LivePlaybackControllerTest` test skeleton with fake implementations

**Behavior Contract Compliance (documented in KDoc):**
- LIVE playback never participates in resume (Section 3.1)
- Kids gating handled by existing `KidsPlaybackGate`
- Controller is domain-only (pure Kotlin, no Android dependencies)

### Next Steps (Phase 3 – Step 2)

The following migration work remains for Step 2:
- [ ] Implement LiveChannelRepository wrapping XtreamObxRepository/ObxLive
- [ ] Implement LiveEpgRepository wrapping existing EpgRepository
- [ ] Migrate `initFromPlaybackContext` logic from legacy screen
- [ ] Migrate `jumpChannel`/`selectChannel` logic from legacy screen
- [ ] Migrate EPG overlay timing logic from legacy screen

## Phase 3 – Step 3.A: InternalPlayerUiState Live-TV Fields Added

**Date:** 2025-11-26

This step extends `InternalPlayerUiState` with basic Live-TV fields required by the SIP UI, without wiring them to any behavior yet.

### What Was Done

**Extended InternalPlayerUiState with Live-TV fields:**

Added four new fields to support Live-TV playback in the SIP UI:

| Field | Type | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| `liveChannelName` | String? | Name of the current live channel |
| `liveNowTitle` | String? | Current program title (now playing) |
| `liveNextTitle` | String? | Next program title (upcoming) |
| `epgOverlayVisible` | Boolean | Whether the EPG overlay is visible |

**Field Documentation:**
- All fields have comprehensive KDoc documenting their future Phase 3 UI consumption
- Fields are properly annotated as "Phase 3 Step 3.A fields"
- All fields are nullable (except `epgOverlayVisible` which defaults to `false`)
- Fields follow the existing pattern in `InternalPlayerUiState` for optional features

**Created Comprehensive Test Coverage:**

New test file: `InternalPlayerUiStatePhase3LiveTest.kt`

Test coverage includes:
- Default values validation (all null/false by default)
- Field setting and retrieval
- Data class copy operations
- Field independence tests
- Integration with existing fields (isLive property)
- Edge cases (empty strings, long strings, special characters)

### Files Modified

**Modified Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/state/InternalPlayerState.kt` - Added Live-TV fields

**New Files:**
- `app/src/test/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/state/InternalPlayerUiStatePhase3LiveTest.kt` - Test coverage

### Runtime Status

- ✅ Runtime path unchanged: `InternalPlayerEntry` → legacy `InternalPlayerScreen`
- ✅ New fields are pure data extensions (no behavior)
- ✅ No state mapping performed
- ✅ No UI changes performed
- ✅ No dependencies on other modules
- ✅ All fields properly documented and tested

### Build & Test Status

- ✅ `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` builds successfully
- ✅ `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "*.InternalPlayerUiStatePhase3LiveTest"` passes all 21 tests
- ✅ `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "*.InternalPlayerSessionPhase2Test"` passes (no regressions)

### Phase 3 Status

Phase 3 - Step 3.A is **COMPLETE** ✅

Completed Phase 3 steps:
- [x] Step 1: Shadow mode initialization (InternalPlayerShadow entry point)
- [x] Step 2: Legacy↔Shadow parity comparison pipeline
- [x] Step 3: Controls shadow mode activated
- [x] Step 4: Spec-driven diagnostics integration
- [x] LivePlaybackController structural foundation (PR #307)
- [x] **Step 3.A: UiState Live fields added** ✅ **NEW**

Remaining Phase 3 work:
- [ ] Step 3.B: Wire LivePlaybackController to populate Live-TV fields
- [ ] Step 3.C: Integrate EPG overlay state management
- [ ] Implement shadow session internals
- [ ] Wire shadow session to observe real playback inputs
- [ ] Add diagnostics logging for shadow state
- [ ] Create verification workflow to compare modular vs legacy behavior
- [ ] Add developer toggle for shadow mode activation

### Next Steps (Phase 3 – Step 3.B)

The following work remains for Step 3.B:
- [ ] Wire `LivePlaybackController.currentChannel` to populate `liveChannelName`
- [ ] Wire `LivePlaybackController.epgOverlay` to populate `liveNowTitle`, `liveNextTitle`, `epgOverlayVisible`
- [ ] Add state mapping logic in InternalPlayerSession
- [ ] Add tests for state mapping

---

## Phase 3 – Step 3.B: LivePlaybackController → UiState Mapping in SIP Session

**Date:** 2025-11-26

This step completes the wiring of LivePlaybackController StateFlows into InternalPlayerUiState for LIVE playback sessions, without touching the legacy UI or any composables.

### What Was Done

**1. Created Repository Implementations:**

Created concrete implementations that bridge the LivePlaybackController to the existing data layer:

- **DefaultLiveChannelRepository.kt**
  - Wraps `ObxStore` to access `ObxLive` entities
  - Converts `ObxLive` to domain `LiveChannel` models
  - Supports category-based filtering (uses `categoryId` field)
  - Handles ID mapping: `ObxLive.streamId` (Int) → `LiveChannel.id` (Long)

- **DefaultLiveEpgRepository.kt**
  - Wraps existing `EpgRepository` class
  - Delegates to `EpgRepository.nowNext(streamId, limit)` method
  - Extracts now/next titles from `XtShortEPGProgramme` list
  - Returns `Pair<String?, String?>` for EPG titles

**2. Wired LivePlaybackController in InternalPlayerSession:**

Modified `rememberInternalPlayerSession` to:
- Create `DefaultLivePlaybackController` when `playbackContext.type == PlaybackType.LIVE`
- Initialize controller from `PlaybackContext` after player setup
- Collect `currentChannel` StateFlow → map to `liveChannelName`
- Collect `epgOverlay` StateFlow → map to `liveNowTitle`, `liveNextTitle`, `epgOverlayVisible`
- Use existing session scope for flow collection (structured concurrency)
- Cancel collection when session is disposed

**State Mapping Logic:**
```kotlin
// Collect currentChannel StateFlow
scope.launch {
    liveController.currentChannel.collect { channel ->
        val updated = playerState.value.copy(
            liveChannelName = channel?.name,
        )
        playerState.value = updated
        onStateChanged(updated)
    }
}

// Collect epgOverlay StateFlow
scope.launch {
    liveController.epgOverlay.collect { overlay ->
        val updated = playerState.value.copy(
            liveNowTitle = overlay.nowTitle,
            liveNextTitle = overlay.nextTitle,
            epgOverlayVisible = overlay.visible,
        )
        playerState.value = updated
        onStateChanged(updated)
    }
}
```

**3. Created Comprehensive Tests:**

New test file: `InternalPlayerSessionPhase3LiveMappingTest.kt`

Test coverage includes:
- **LIVE playback with controller emitting channel data**
  - currentChannel → liveChannelName mapping
  - epgOverlay → nowTitle, nextTitle, epgOverlayVisible mapping
  - Full controller state (combined channel + EPG)
- **Null / default value handling**
  - Null channel falls back gracefully
  - Null EPG titles fall back gracefully
  - EPG overlay not visible
  - Default controller state (no crashes)
- **Non-LIVE playback types**
  - VOD playback has null Live-TV fields
  - SERIES playback has null Live-TV fields
- Uses `FakeLivePlaybackController` with controllable `MutableStateFlow`s
- Tests data transformation (not coroutine/lifecycle behavior)

### Files Added/Modified

**New Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/live/DefaultLiveChannelRepository.kt`
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/live/DefaultLiveEpgRepository.kt`
- `app/src/test/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/session/InternalPlayerSessionPhase3LiveMappingTest.kt`

**Modified Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/session/InternalPlayerSession.kt`
  - Added LivePlaybackController creation for LIVE sessions
  - Added controller initialization from PlaybackContext
  - Added StateFlow collection and mapping to UiState
  - Added imports for live module classes

### Runtime Status

- ✅ Runtime path unchanged: `InternalPlayerEntry` → legacy `InternalPlayerScreen`
- ✅ SIP session with LivePlaybackController is non-runtime (Phase 3 reference implementation)
- ✅ No functional changes to production player flow
- ✅ LivePlaybackController is wired but not activated in runtime
- ✅ LIVE resume exclusion remains unchanged (handled in ResumeManager)
- ✅ Kids gate unchanged (no KidsPlaybackGate modifications)
- ✅ Non-LIVE playback keeps defaults (null/false)

### Build & Test Status

- ✅ `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin` builds successfully
- ✅ `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest --tests "*InternalPlayerSessionPhase3LiveMappingTest*"` passes all tests
- ✅ No regressions in existing tests

### Behavior Constraints Verified

1. ✅ **LIVE remains excluded from ResumeManager** (already handled in Phase 2)
2. ✅ **No BehaviorContractEnforcer calls** (controller is domain-only)
3. ✅ **No KidsPlaybackGate modifications** (kids gate is separate concern)
4. ✅ **Non-LIVE playback keeps defaults** (controller is null for VOD/SERIES)

### Phase 3 Status

Phase 3 - Step 3.B is **COMPLETE** ✅

Completed Phase 3 steps:
- [x] Step 1: Shadow mode initialization (InternalPlayerShadow entry point)
- [x] Step 2: Legacy↔Shadow parity comparison pipeline
- [x] Step 3: Controls shadow mode activated
- [x] Step 4: Spec-driven diagnostics integration

## Phase 3 – Step 3.C: SIP InternalPlayerContent Live-TV UI Rendering

**Date:** 2025-11-26

This step completes the visual integration of Live-TV fields in the SIP UI path by modifying `InternalPlayerContent` to render channel name and EPG overlay, without touching legacy code or behavior.

### What Was Done

**1. Modified InternalPlayerContent Composable:**

Added conditional rendering for Live-TV UI elements:

**Live Channel Header:**
- Rendered when: `state.isLive && state.liveChannelName != null`
- Positioned at top-center of player
- Uses `ElevatedCard` with channel name in `MaterialTheme.typography.titleMedium`
- Simple, minimal design consistent with existing UI

**EPG Overlay:**
- Rendered when: `state.isLive && state.epgOverlayVisible == true`
- Positioned at bottom-left of player (does not interfere with controls)
- Shows "Now" and "Next" program titles when available
- Displays "No EPG data available" when both titles are null
- Uses `ElevatedCard` with structured layout
- **Defensive:** Requires both LIVE playback type AND visibility flag to prevent accidental display on VOD/SERIES

**Behavior Constraints Verified:**
- ✅ No new state introduced (uses only existing `InternalPlayerUiState` fields)
- ✅ Non-LIVE playback types (VOD, SERIES) never show Live UI elements
- ✅ EPG overlay only visible when `epgOverlayVisible == true`
- ✅ Live UI coexists with existing controls without blocking or replacing them
- ✅ No gesture/click handlers added (pure visual integration)

**2. Created Helper Composables:**

- `LiveChannelHeader(channelName: String, modifier: Modifier)`
  - Private composable for channel name rendering
  - Consistent with existing UI patterns in the file
  
- `LiveEpgOverlay(nowTitle: String?, nextTitle: String?, modifier: Modifier)`
  - Private composable for EPG data rendering
  - Handles null titles gracefully
  - Shows placeholder when no data available

**3. Created Comprehensive Tests:**

New test file: `InternalPlayerContentPhase3LiveUiTest.kt`

Test coverage includes (19 tests total):
- **LIVE playback scenarios:**
  - Channel name rendering conditions
  - EPG overlay visibility control
  - All Live fields populated
  - EPG overlay hidden when flag is false
  - Null EPG titles handling
  - Partial EPG data (only nowTitle)
  
- **Non-LIVE playback scenarios:**
  - VOD with accidentally set Live fields (defensive)
  - SERIES with Live fields set
  - VOD with null Live fields
  
- **Edge cases:**
  - LIVE with null channel name (no header)
  - Empty string channel name
  - Long channel names and titles
  - Special characters in fields
  
- **Default state:**
  - Validates no Live UI renders by default

### Files Modified/Created

**Modified Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/ui/InternalPlayerControls.kt`
  - Modified `InternalPlayerContent` composable
  - Added `LiveChannelHeader` helper composable
  - Added `LiveEpgOverlay` helper composable

**New Files:**
- `app/src/test/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/ui/InternalPlayerContentPhase3LiveUiTest.kt`
  - Comprehensive UI logic tests (19 tests)
  - Validates rendering conditions for all scenarios

### Runtime Status

- ✅ Runtime path unchanged: `InternalPlayerEntry` → legacy `InternalPlayerScreen`
- ✅ SIP `InternalPlayerContent` is non-runtime (Phase 3 reference implementation)
- ✅ No functional changes to production player flow
- ✅ Live-TV UI ready for Phase 3+ activation
- ✅ No legacy code modified
- ✅ No gesture handling added
- ✅ Pure visual integration only

### Build & Test Status

- ✅ `./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin` builds successfully
- ✅ `./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest` passes all tests (including 19 new tests)
- ✅ No regressions in existing tests
- ✅ ktlint checks pass for new code

### Behavior Contract Compliance

1. ✅ **LIVE playback never participates in resume** (unchanged, handled in Phase 2)
2. ✅ **No behavior logic added** (pure UI mapping)
3. ✅ **Non-LIVE types excluded** (channel header uses `state.isLive` check)
4. ✅ **EPG overlay controlled by state** (no internal state management)
5. ✅ **No navigation added** (no click handlers, no channel switching)

### Design Decisions

**Positioning:**
- Channel header at top-center: Visible but not obtrusive
- EPG overlay at bottom-left: Avoids collision with controls at bottom-center

**Styling:**
- Used existing `MaterialTheme.typography` tokens
- Consistent with other overlays (e.g., `DebugInfoOverlay`)
- `ElevatedCard` for both elements (matches debug overlay pattern)

**Null Handling:**
- Channel header: Only renders when `liveChannelName != null`
- EPG overlay: Renders structure even with null titles, shows placeholder

**Future Activation:**
When Phase 3+ activates the SIP path:
1. InternalPlayerSession will populate Live fields from LivePlaybackController
2. InternalPlayerContent will automatically render channel + EPG based on state
3. No additional UI work needed for basic Live-TV display

## Phase 3 – Step 3.D: SIP PlayerSurface Horizontal Swipe → Live jumpChannel

**Date:** 2025-11-26

This step wires horizontal swipe gestures in the SIP PlayerSurface to trigger Live channel zapping via a callback, without touching the legacy InternalPlayerScreen or changing existing VOD/SERIES behavior.

### What Was Done

**1. Created PlayerSurface.kt composable:**

A new composable that encapsulates the ExoPlayer PlayerView and handles gesture input:

- **Tap gesture:** Invokes `onTap()` callback (for future control visibility toggling)
- **Horizontal swipe gesture (LIVE only):**
  - Swipe right (left-to-right) → calls `onJumpLiveChannel(-1)` (previous channel)
  - Swipe left (right-to-left) → calls `onJumpLiveChannel(+1)` (next channel)
  - Threshold: 60px (matches legacy implementation)
  - Distinguishes horizontal vs vertical based on drag axis dominance
- **VOD/SERIES:** Gestures are ignored (future phases will add seek/trickplay)

**Key Features:**
- `playbackType` parameter determines behavior (LIVE vs VOD/SERIES)
- `onJumpLiveChannel` callback has default no-op implementation (safe for non-LIVE usage)
- AspectRatioMode support (FIT, FILL, ZOOM, STRETCH)
- PlayerView configuration matches existing patterns

**2. Extended InternalPlayerController:**

Added new method to the controller interface:
```kotlin
val onJumpLiveChannel: (delta: Int) -> Unit = {}
```

- Default no-op implementation for backward compatibility
- Only meaningful for LIVE playback
- Delta values: +1 for next channel, -1 for previous channel

**3. Updated InternalPlayerContent:**

Modified to use PlayerSurface instead of placeholder comment:
- Threads `controller.onJumpLiveChannel` callback to PlayerSurface
- `playbackType` and `aspectRatioMode` passed from state
- Existing Live-TV UI elements (channel header, EPG overlay) remain unchanged
- Controls and debug overlay remain functional

**4. Added LivePlaybackController Wiring Documentation:**

Added TODO comment in InternalPlayerSession showing how future SIP screens will wire:
```kotlin
val controller = InternalPlayerController(
    // ... other callbacks ...
    onJumpLiveChannel = { delta ->
        if (playbackContext.type == PlaybackType.LIVE) {
            liveController?.jumpChannel(delta)
        }
    }
)
```

This documents the pathway but doesn't implement it yet (SIP session is non-runtime).

**5. Created PlayerSurfacePhase3LiveGestureTest.kt:**

Comprehensive test suite (19 tests) covering:

**LIVE Playback Scenarios:**
- Swipe right → delta +1
- Swipe left → delta -1
- Threshold boundary tests (60px)
- Below threshold → no callback
- Vertical swipe → no horizontal callback
- Diagonal swipe with horizontal dominance → triggers callback

**VOD/SERIES Playback Scenarios:**
- Horizontal swipe → no callback (any magnitude)
- Callback never invoked for non-LIVE types

**Edge Cases:**
- Zero drag
- Exact threshold boundary
- Just above threshold

**Integration Tests:**
- PlaybackType enum coverage
- AspectRatioMode enum coverage
- Callback optionality

Tests use `simulateGestureLogic` helper to abstract pointer gesture mechanics for unit testing without Compose runtime.

### Files Added/Modified

**New Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/ui/PlayerSurface.kt`

- ✅ SIP PlayerSurface + InternalPlayerContent are non-runtime (Phase 3 reference)
- ✅ No functional changes to production player flow
- ✅ Legacy gesture handling in InternalPlayerScreen remains active
- ✅ VOD/SERIES behavior unchanged (gestures ignored in PlayerSurface)

### Behavior Constraints Verified

1. ✅ **Legacy InternalPlayerScreen untouched** (no changes to legacy file)
2. ✅ **VOD/SERIES gestures unchanged** (gestures only active for LIVE in PlayerSurface)
3. ✅ **Callback is optional** (default no-op in InternalPlayerController)
4. ✅ **Non-blocking gesture handling** (uses detectDragGestures async API)
5. ✅ **Consistent threshold** (60px matches legacy implementation)
6. ✅ **No DPAD/TV remote changes** (gesture handling only for touch/mouse)
7. ✅ **No new overlays or navigation** (pure gesture → callback wiring)

### Phase 3 Status

Phase 3 - Step 3.D is **COMPLETE** ✅

Completed Phase 3 steps:
- [x] Step 1: Shadow mode initialization (InternalPlayerShadow entry point)

---

## Phase 3 – Task 1: Live-TV Robustness & Data Integrity Complete

**Date:** 2025-11-26

This task implements comprehensive robustness features for DefaultLivePlaybackController to ensure predictable behavior and prevent legacy bugs from manifesting in the modular architecture.

### What Was Done

**1. EPG Stale Detection:**
- Tracks last EPG update timestamp and nowTitle
- Auto-detects when EPG data hasn't changed for configurable threshold (default: 3 minutes)
- Updates metrics when stale EPG is detected
- Designed for future auto-refresh integration via coroutine scope

**2. EPG Fallback & Caching:**
- Caches last-known-good EpgOverlayState per channel ID
- On repository errors, uses cached values instead of returning nulls
- Prevents EPG overlay from flickering into "empty" state after errors
- Tracks cache hit count in metrics

**3. Smart Channel Zapping:**
- Filters out channels with null or empty URLs during initialization
- Removes duplicate channel entries based on URL
- Applies category hint filtering from PlaybackContext
- Tracks skipped channel count in metrics
- Maintains wrap-around behavior

**4. Controller Sanity Guards:**
- `jumpChannel` never crashes on empty/invalid channel lists
- `epgOverlay` always emits safe structure (catch blocks prevent throws)
- Overlay automatically hides when switching channels (prevents stale overlay)
- `onPlaybackPositionChanged` never throws exceptions

**5. Live Metrics Exposure:**
- Created `LiveMetrics` data class with diagnostic counters
- Exposed `liveMetrics` StateFlow in `LivePlaybackController` interface
- Tracks: EPG refresh count, cache hit count, stale detection count, channel skip count
- Designed for shadow diagnostics aggregation (SIP-only)

### Files Added/Modified

**New Files:**
- `app/src/main/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/live/LiveMetrics.kt`
- `app/src/test/java/com/chris/m3usuite/player/internal/live/LiveControllerRobustnessTest.kt`

## Phase 3 – Task 2: SIP Live-TV Interaction & UX Polish ✅ **DONE**

**Date:** 2025-11-26

This task completes the SIP-only Live-TV interaction polish by implementing deterministic jump throttling, immediate EPG overlay hiding on channel changes, and LiveEpgInfoState wiring. All tests pass without modification.

### What Was Done

**A) DefaultLivePlaybackController.kt:**
1. **Deterministic 200ms Jump Throttle:**
   - Added `lastJumpAtRealtimeMs: Long = 0L` field
   - Added `jumpThrottleMs: Long = 200L` constant
   - Implemented throttle check: `if (now - lastJumpAtRealtimeMs < jumpThrottleMs) return`
   - Updates `lastJumpAtRealtimeMs = now` after each successful jump
   - Uses injected TimeProvider for testable, deterministic behavior

2. **Immediate EPG Overlay Hiding on Channel Changes:**
   - `jumpChannel()` hides overlay immediately with `hideAtRealtimeMs = now`
   - `selectChannel()` hides overlay immediately with `hideAtRealtimeMs = now`
   - New helper method `hideEpgOverlayImmediate(now)` for Task 2 behavior
   - Preserved legacy `hideEpgOverlay()` for backward compatibility

3. **LiveEpgInfoState Population:**
   - Created `LiveEpgInfoState` data class with `nowTitle`, `nextTitle`, `progressPercent`
   - Added `liveEpgInfoState` StateFlow to `LivePlaybackController` interface
   - Populated state in `showEpgOverlayWithAutoHide()` whenever EPG overlay updates
   - Progress percent set to 0.0f for LIVE content (no duration)

**B) InternalPlayerContent.kt:**
1. **AnimatedVisibility Integration:**
   - Replaced simple `if` statement with `AnimatedVisibility`
   - Uses `state.epgOverlayVisible` directly without delays or gating
   - Fade-in animation: 200ms duration
   - Fade-out animation: 200ms duration
   - Visibility flag flips immediately, animation plays smoothly

**C) File Structure Updates:**
- Created `LiveEpgInfoState.kt` with KDoc documentation
- Updated `LivePlaybackController.kt` interface

This update completes Phase 4 Groups 3 and 4 as specified in the problem statement.

### What Was Completed

**Group 3: SIP Session Integration (Complete) ✅**

Fully integrated subtitle functionality into the SIP player session:

- ✅ **Wire DefaultSubtitleStyleManager into InternalPlayerSession**
  - Instantiated with SettingsStore and coroutine scope
  - Collects `currentStyle` StateFlow
  - Maps style changes to `InternalPlayerUiState.subtitleStyle`

- ✅ **Wire DefaultSubtitleSelectionPolicy for track selection**
  - Instantiated with SettingsStore
  - Selects initial subtitle track on `onTracksChanged` event
  - Respects language preferences (system → profile languages)
  - Honors default flag on tracks

- ✅ **Apply subtitle track selection via Media3**
  - Extract subtitle tracks from `Tracks.groups` (type == C.TRACK_TYPE_TEXT)
  - Create `SubtitleTrack` models from Media3 Format data
  - Apply selection via `TrackSelectionOverride`
  - Update `InternalPlayerUiState.selectedSubtitleTrack`

- ✅ **Apply SubtitleStyle to Media3 subtitleView**
  - Modified `PlayerSurface` to accept `subtitleStyle` and `isKidMode` parameters
  - Map `SubtitleStyle` to `CaptionStyleCompat` in both factory and update blocks
  - Apply fractional text size from `textScale`
  - Convert foreground/background colors with opacity via `applyOpacity()` helper
  - Map `EdgeStyle` to CaptionStyleCompat edge types
  - Pass style from `InternalPlayerContent` to `PlayerSurface`

- ✅ **Enforce Kid Mode**
  - Kid Mode check in `onTracksChanged`: skips track selection when `kidActive == true`
  - Kid Mode check in `PlayerSurface`: skips style application when `isKidMode == true`
  - Clear subtitle tracks via `clearOverridesOfType(C.TRACK_TYPE_TEXT)` for kid profiles
  - Update `selectedSubtitleTrack = null` for kid profiles

**Group 4: CC Menu UI (Complete) ✅**

Implemented CC menu dialog with all required controls:

- ✅ **Add CC button to InternalPlayerControls**
  - Added `onCcClick` parameter to `MainControlsRow`
  - Wire `controller.onToggleCcMenu` callback
  - CC button uses `Icons.Filled.ClosedCaption` icon

- ✅ **Implement visibility rules (Contract Section 8.1)**
  - Visible only when `!state.kidActive` (non-kid profiles)
  - Visible only when `state.selectedSubtitleTrack != null` (has subtitle tracks)

- ✅ **Create CcMenuDialog composable**
  - Created `/internal/ui/CcMenuDialog.kt` (305 lines)
  - Full-screen dialog with Material3 Card
  - All required control segments:
    - **Track Selection**: Off button + up to 3 track buttons
    - **Text Size**: Slider (0.5x - 2.0x) with live value display
    - **Foreground Opacity**: Slider (50% - 100%) with percentage display
    - **Background Opacity**: Slider (0% - 100%) with percentage display
    - **Edge Style**: Button group (NONE, OUTLINE, SHADOW, GLOW)
    - **Presets**: Button group (DEFAULT, HIGH_CONTRAST, TV_LARGE, MINIMAL)

- ✅ **Live Preview (Contract Section 8.5)**
  - `SubtitlePreview` composable shows "Example Subtitle Text"
  - Reflects pending style changes immediately
  - Black background with styled text
  - Text size scales with `pendingStyle.textScale`
  - Color and opacity applied from `pendingStyle`

- ✅ **Dialog Actions**
  - Cancel button: dismisses without applying changes
  - Apply button: calls `onApplyStyle(pendingStyle)` and dismisses
  - Preset buttons: immediately update pending style and call `onApplyPreset()`

- ✅ **State Management**
  - Add `showCcMenuDialog` field to `InternalPlayerUiState`
  - Dialog shown when `state.showCcMenuDialog && !state.kidActive`
  - TODO markers added for full SubtitleStyleManager integration

  - Contract Reference: Section 4.2 Rule 3

- ✅ **Task 1.3: XML Layout Black Background**
  - Added `android:background="@android:color/black"` to `compose_player_view.xml`
  - Provides XML-level safety for black background
  - Contract Reference: Section 4.2

**Group 2: Aspect Ratio Modes & Switching ✅ COMPLETE**

- ✅ **Task 2.1: AspectRatioMode Enum Verified**
  - Existing FIT/FILL/ZOOM/STRETCH enum matches contract
  - `toResizeMode()` mapping is correct:
    - FIT → RESIZE_MODE_FIT (entire video fits, black bars if needed)
    - FILL → RESIZE_MODE_FILL (fills viewport, crops edges)
    - ZOOM → RESIZE_MODE_ZOOM (aggressive crop)
    - STRETCH → RESIZE_MODE_FIXED_WIDTH (legacy compatibility)
  - Contract Reference: Section 4.1

- ✅ **Task 2.2: Aspect Ratio Cycling Logic**
  - Added `AspectRatioMode.next()` extension function
  - Deterministic cycling: FIT → FILL → ZOOM → FIT
  - STRETCH returns to FIT (fallback)
  - Contract Reference: Section 4.1, Legacy L1374-1379

- ✅ **Task 2.3: Controller Integration**
  - `onCycleAspectRatio` callback already exists in `InternalPlayerController`
  - Black background maintained during mode switches (verified by tests)

**Group 5 (Partial): Tests ✅ PARTIAL**

- ✅ **Created `PlayerSurfacePhase5BlackBarTest.kt`**
  - 14 unit tests covering:
    - Black background constant verification
    - 21:9 video on 16:9 viewport (letterbox) black bar assertion
    - 4:3 video on 16:9 viewport (pillarbox) black bar assertion
    - Shutter background during initial buffering
    - AspectRatioMode → resizeMode mapping (all 4 modes)
    - Aspect ratio cycling (FIT → FILL → ZOOM → FIT)
    - STRETCH fallback to FIT
    - Deterministic cycling behavior
    - Aspect ratio changes don't affect black background

  - Added `onStepSeek(deltaMs: Long)` callback
  - Added `TrickplayDirection` enum (FORWARD=1, REWIND=-1)

- ✅ **Task 3.3: Trickplay Session Logic (Foundation)**
  - State model and controller callbacks defined
  - Actual ExoPlayer speed manipulation deferred to session wiring (future activation)

- ✅ **Task 3.4: Seek Preview Logic (Foundation)**
  - State fields for seek preview defined
  - UI rendering implemented
  - Session-level auto-hide logic to be wired at activation

- ✅ **Task 3.5: Trickplay UI in InternalPlayerControls**
  - Created `TrickplayIndicator` composable (e.g., "2x ►►" or "◀◀ 3x")
  - Created `SeekPreviewOverlay` composable showing target position and delta
  - Overlays centered with AnimatedVisibility fade transitions (150ms)
  - Black semi-transparent backgrounds (70% opacity) for readability

- ✅ **Task 3.6: Trickplay Gesture Handling**
  - Added `onStepSeek` callback parameter to PlayerSurface
  - For VOD/SERIES: Horizontal swipe triggers step seek
    - Small swipe (≤150px): ±10s
    - Large swipe (>150px): ±30s
  - Direction: swipe right = forward, swipe left = backward
  - LIVE playback uses existing channel zapping (not trickplay)
  - 60px threshold maintained

**Group 4: Controls Auto-Hide (TV vs Touch) ✅ COMPLETE**

- ✅ **Task 4.1: Auto-Hide State Model**
  - Added `controlsVisible: Boolean = true` to InternalPlayerUiState
  - Added `controlsTick: Int = 0` (increment resets timer)
  - Added `hasBlockingOverlay` computed property

- ✅ **Task 4.2: Auto-Hide Timer Logic**
  - Implemented LaunchedEffect in InternalPlayerContent
  - TV timeout: 7 seconds (contract: 5-7s)
  - Phone/tablet timeout: 4 seconds (contract: 3-5s)
  - Timer resets when `controlsTick` changes
  - Timer blocked when `hasBlockingOverlay` or `trickplayActive` is true

- ✅ **Task 4.3: Activity Detection**
  - Added `onUserInteraction()` callback to reset timer
  - Added `onToggleControlsVisibility()` callback
  - Added `onHideControls()` callback for timer-triggered hide

    - `showCcMenuDialog`
    - `showSettingsDialog`
    - `showTracksDialog`
    - `showSpeedDialog`
    - `showSleepTimerDialog`
    - `kidBlocked`
  - LaunchedEffect respects blocking overlay flag
  - LaunchedEffect respects trickplayActive flag

  - PlayerSurface `onTap` now triggers `onToggleControlsVisibility()`
  - Controls wrapped in AnimatedVisibility with 200ms fade transitions

**Group 5 (Partial): Tests ✅ PARTIAL**

- ✅ **Created `InternalPlayerTrickplayPhase5Test.kt`**
  - 24 tests covering:
    - Trickplay state fields (defaults, activation, speeds)
    - TrickplayDirection enum behavior
    - Seek preview state
    - Aspect ratio preservation during trickplay
    - Playback type interactions
    - State transitions
