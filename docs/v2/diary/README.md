## Generation

Diary entries are automatically generated by:

1. **Nightly Workflow**: `copilot-nightly-summary.yml`
   - Runs daily at 00:00 UTC
   - Analyzes all commits from the previous day
   - Creates detailed programming diary entry
   - Only runs if there were changes that day

2. **Post-Commit Workflow**: `copilot-doc-maintenance.yml`
   - Runs after each push to main branches
   - Updates CHANGELOG.md, ROADMAP.md
   - Detects architecture/contract changes
   - Triggers documentation updates

## Manual Entries

While this system is automated, manual entries can be added if needed:

1. Create a file following the naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD.md`
2. Use the standard entry format above
3. Add a note indicating manual entry

## Retention Policy

- Entries are kept indefinitely as part of project history
- Monthly/yearly summaries may be generated for long-term reference
- Entries become part of the git history for complete auditability
