#### Analysis

**Areas Affected:**
- CI/Workflow changes
- Documentation changes

**What Changed:**
Two new GitHub Actions workflows were created to automate documentation maintenance:

1. **Post-Commit Documentation Maintenance** (`copilot-doc-maintenance.yml`):
   - Triggers on push to main branches
   - Parses conventional commit format
   - Updates CHANGELOG.md automatically
   - Detects architecture/contract changes
   - Warns about potential layer violations

2. **Nightly Programming Diary** (`copilot-nightly-summary.yml`):
   - Runs at midnight UTC daily
   - Analyzes all commits from the day
   - Creates structured diary entries
   - Documents changes with full context

**Why:**
- Manual documentation maintenance is error-prone and often neglected
- Automating documentation ensures consistency and completeness
- Programming diary provides valuable historical context
- Reduces cognitive load on developers

**Previous State:**
Before this change, documentation maintenance was:
- Entirely manual process
- Often forgotten or inconsistent
- No automated changelog generation
- No development journal or diary

**Impact:**
- CHANGELOG.md will be automatically updated after each commit
- Daily diary entries will be generated in `docs/diary/`
- Architecture/contract changes will be flagged automatically
- Development history will be fully documented

**Diff Stats:** 4 files changed, 863 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)

## Documentation Updates

- Created `docs/diary/README.md` explaining the diary system
- Created `docs/diary/templates/daily-entry-template.md` for reference

---

## Notes

This is the inaugural diary entry, created during the initial setup of the automated documentation system.

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Diary Structure**: Using `YYYY/MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md` format for organization
2. **Workflow Triggers**: Using `[skip ci]` to prevent infinite loops
3. **Conventional Commits**: Parsing commit messages for categorization
4. **Layer Detection**: Analyzing file paths to identify affected areas

### Future Enhancements

- Consider integrating with GitHub Issues/Projects
- Add support for generating weekly/monthly summaries
- Integrate with release notes generation

---

**Next Steps:**
- Verify workflows run correctly on next push
- Monitor for any edge cases in commit parsing
- Gather feedback on diary entry format
