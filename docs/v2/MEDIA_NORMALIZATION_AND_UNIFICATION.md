# Media Normalization & Cross-Pipeline Unification (v2 Architecture)

**Purpose of this Document:**  
Define a single, deterministic, pipeline-agnostic metadata model and unification process so that the FishIT-Player can reliably treat media from **all pipelines** (Telegram, Xtream, IO, Audiobook, Local, Plex, etc.) as one unified library.  
This includes: canonical identity, centralized normalization, TMDB-first resolution, and agent responsibilities.

This document replaces all implicit assumptions about title matching, identity heuristics, normalization strategies, and pipeline metadata formats.

# 🎯 1. Overall Goals

1. Every media work (movie, series, episode) receives a **global, pipeline-independent identity** (`CanonicalMediaId`).
2. Every pipeline provides **RawMediaMetadata only** — no normalization, no title cleaning, no heuristics.
3. All normalization happens **centrally** inside:
   ```
   :core:metadata-normalizer
   ```
4. TMDB IDs act as **absolute identity keys** when available.
5. Without TMDB IDs, titles, years, and season/episode numbers are normalized through a **shared, deterministic heuristic layer** (regex-based, scene-naming aware).
6. Features enabled by this:
   - cross-pipeline resume  
   - unified detail screen  
   - version selection across Telegram/Xtream/IO/etc.  
   - best-source selection  
   - grouping multiple versions of the same media work  
   - predictable search & categorization

# 🧱 2. Tools Used

## 🧩 2.1 `tmdb-java` (Apache 2.0 License)
**Purpose:**
- Find movies/series via TMDB search
- Obtain reliable `tmdbId`
- Fetch titles, release years, posters, runtime, genres

**Gradle Integration:**
```kotlin
dependencies {
    implementation("com.uwetrottmann.tmdb2:tmdb-java:<latest-version>")
}
```

## 🧩 2.2 Scene/Title Parser (Custom Kotlin Regex Engine)
We implement a **dedicated Kotlin-based scene/title parser**, inspired by behavior and regex patterns from Sonarr, Radarr, GuessIt, and FileBot.

We do *not* embed their code directly — only port behaviors and patterns.

This parser extracts:
- cleaned title ("x-men")
- release year
- season/episode (S01E05 / 1x05)
- edition tags (extended, directors cut, etc.)
- resolution & media source (1080p, 4K, BluRay, WebRip)

This parser lives in:

```
:core:metadata-normalizer
```

# 🧩 2.3 Centralized Metadata Normalizer Module

New module added:

```
:core:metadata-normalizer
```

### Types

```kotlin
data class RawMediaMetadata(
    val originalTitle: String,
    val year: Int? = null,
    val season: Int? = null,
    val episode: Int? = null,
    val durationMinutes: Int? = null,
    val externalIds: ExternalIds = ExternalIds(),
    val sourceType: SourceType,
    val sourceLabel: String,
    val sourceId: String
)

data class NormalizedMediaMetadata(
    val canonicalTitle: String,
    val year: Int?,
    val season: Int?,
    val episode: Int?,
    val tmdbId: String?,
    val externalIds: ExternalIds
)
```

### Services

```kotlin
interface MediaMetadataNormalizer {
    suspend fun normalize(raw: RawMediaMetadata): NormalizedMediaMetadata
}
```

### TMDB Resolver

```kotlin
interface TmdbMetadataResolver {
    suspend fun enrich(metadata: NormalizedMediaMetadata): NormalizedMediaMetadata
}
```

### Rules

1. **If `tmdbId` is present → it becomes the canonical identity.**
2. If not:
   - Normalize title via regex-cleaning
   - Extract year, season, episode
   - Search TMDB using normalized title & year
3. If TMDB match exists:
   - Set `tmdbId`
4. Normalized output becomes the basis for:
   - CanonicalMediaId
   - Resume unification
   - Unified detail screens
   - Version grouping

# 🧭 3. Pipeline Agent Responsibilities

## ❗ Mandatory for ALL pipelines

### Pipelines MUST expose:
```kotlin
fun PipelineMediaItem.toRawMediaMetadata(): RawMediaMetadata
```

### Pipelines MUST NOT:
- implement their own title cleaning  
- apply heuristics  
- perform TMDB searches  
- unify or match media across versions  
- decide identity between items  

### Pipelines MUST:
- extract all raw metadata they can provide (title, year, season/episode, duration)
- include external IDs when available (e.g., tmdbId from Xtream or Plex)
- populate `sourceType`, `sourceLabel`, `sourceId`
- ensure deterministic mappings

### Pipeline Tests MUST:
- verify RawMediaMetadata generation  
- NOT test normalization, TMDB resolution, or canonical identity  
(those belong to the normalizer + unifier modules)

# 🏗 4. Required Changes to Existing Markdown Documents

## 📌 Update: `APP_VISION_AND_SCOPE.md`
Add new subsection:
- “Cross-Pipeline Media Identity Layer”
- Pipelines deliver raw metadata only
- TMDB-first canonical identity
- Normalization + unification handled centrally

---

## 📌 Update: `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW_V2.md`
Add:
- new module `:core:metadata-normalizer`
- new canonical media flow:
  ```
  Pipeline → RawMediaMetadata → Normalizer → CanonicalMedia → Resume/UI
  ```

---

## 📌 Update: `IMPLEMENTATION_PHASES_V2.md`

Add new subtasks:

### Phase 3 — Metadata Normalization Core
- Introduce Raw/Normalized metadata types
- Implement MediaMetadataNormalizer
- Implement TmdbMetadataResolver
- Add metadata-normalizer module

### Phase 4 — Pipeline Metadata Integration
- Telegram: toRawMediaMetadata()
- Xtream: toRawMediaMetadata()
- IO: toRawMediaMetadata()
- Audiobook: toRawMediaMetadata()

### Phase 5 — Canonical Media Storage
- Store CanonicalMedia + MediaSourceRef in persistence
- Implement cross-pipeline resume + detail screen backend

---

## 📌 Update: `PHASE2_PARALLELIZATION_PLAN.md`
Add:
- Pipeline agents must prepare `toRawMediaMetadata()` in their stub phase
- Normalization begins only after Phase 3 is implemented
- Pipelines remain fully functional without the normalizer → preserves reusability

---

# 🤖 5. How Pipeline Agents Must Adjust Their Behavior

Each agent must:

### a) Implement this function:
```kotlin
fun PipelineMediaItem.toRawMediaMetadata(): RawMediaMetadata
```

### b) Follow these constraints:
- No cleaning logic  
- No regex heuristics  
- No TMDB lookup  
- No identity merging  

### c) Provide complete raw data:
- best-effort extraction of titles, years, season/episode, duration  
- external IDs when the source provides them  
- stable source identifiers

### d) Tests focus ONLY on:
- Raw metadata production  
NOT on:
- normalization  
- TMDB behavior  
- canonical identity

# 🚀 6. Benefits for FishIT-Player

Once this system is active, the app gains:

- unified detail pages  
- pipeline-independent resume  
- version selection (quality, language, subtitles)  
- clean global search  
- grouping all versions of a movie or episode across all pipelines  
- painless addition of new pipelines (Plex, Jellyfin, more Xtream providers)

Pipelines remain fully self-contained and reusable — the intelligence lives in a clean, optional domain layer.

# 🟢 7. Status After Introducing This Document

After this document is committed:

- All future pipeline tasks MUST implement `toRawMediaMetadata()`.
- Normalization logic is strictly centralized.
- TMDB-first identity becomes standard.
- Cross-pipeline canonical identity is enabled for later phases.
