 - TDLib pinning: TDLib (JNI + Java bindings) is pinned to a specific upstream tag for reproducibility. The build script `scripts/tdlib-build-arm64.sh` checks out the tag and copies `TdApi.java`/`Client.java` from TDLib’s `example/java` into `libtd/src/main/java/org/drinkless/tdlib/`. Default pin: `v1.8.0` (the latest upstream tag as of now; override via env `TD_TAG`/`TD_COMMIT` or CLI `--ref <tag|commit>`). `Log.java` stays local to match JNI signatures.
 
+Fire TV Stick (v7a) tuning
+- 32‑bit Fire TV (Amazon AFT*, brand=Amazon) receives conservative resource tuning:
+  - HTTP cache shrunk (base≈16 MiB, low‑RAM≈8 MiB, cap≈32 MiB) to reduce pressure on limited storage/RAM.
+  - Xtream EPG concurrency reduced (2 instead of 4) to avoid CPU/RAM spikes.
+  - Background work is paused while video playback is active: Xtream delta/details, Telegram cache trims, and other safe jobs early‑exit or are canceled. SchedulingGateway resumes them automatically when playback ends. This keeps CPU/network/head‑of‑line blocking away from the player.
+- Global playback gate is persisted in a small perf SharedPreferences and toggled by the internal player enter/exit lifecycle.
+- Non‑v7a/64‑bit devices remain unchanged.

 Where to find the full overview
 - The canonical, continuously updated source is `AGENTS.md` (this file).
 - `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` is a detailed, human‑friendly derivative of this file. If discrepancies occur, this file prevails. Keep `ARCHITECTURE_OVERVIEW.md` updated whenever new modules/features are added.
