 - Ongoing hygiene: Codex periodically tidies the repo, highlights obsolete files/code to the user, and removes uncritical leftovers (e.g., stale *.old files). Never touch `.gradle/`, `.idea/`, or `app/build/` artifacts, and avoid dependency upgrades unless fixing builds.
   - TV focus/DPAD audit: `tools/audit_tv_focus.sh` enforces rules (TvFocusRow for horizontal containers, tvClickable for interactives, no ad‑hoc DPAD). Wired into CI (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) and fails PRs on violations.
 
+- Core-UI basics (shared components): New reusable building blocks are provided under `ui/` to unify actions, images and status handling across screens.
+  - `ui/actions`: MediaActionBar with consistent TV‑ready controls (Play/Resume/Trailer/Add/…); buttons expose testTags and use `focusScaleOnTv`.
+  - `ui/images`: ImageLoaderKit presets and `AppImage`/`AppHeroImage` wrappers (Coil3) that reuse global headers and defaults; compatible with existing `ui/util` image helpers.
+  - `ui/state`: UiState sealed type and Status‑Views (`LoadingStateView`, `EmptyStateView`, `ErrorStateView`, `StatusBox`) to standardize loading/empty/error rendering with retry hooks.
+  - Initial migration is incremental; existing screens remain functional. Further roll‑out is tracked in ROADMAP (Sprint A).
+
 - Xtream workers & delta: Legacy `XtreamRefreshWorker`/`XtreamEnrichmentWorker` remain disabled (no‑op). Xtream content updates via `XtreamDeltaImportWorker`: periodic (12h, unmetered+charging) plus on‑demand one‑shot trigger.
   - Global gate: `M3U_WORKERS_ENABLED` in DataStore controls whether Xtream workers/scheduling and related API paths run. When false, workers early‑exit (no network), app‑start auto‑discovery/seed is skipped, and Settings actions for Xtream diagnostics/import are disabled.
   - One‑shot `ObxKeyBackfillWorker` fills missing `sortTitleLower`/`providerKey`/`genreKey`/`yearKey` for existing OBX rows.
