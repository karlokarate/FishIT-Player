+- Build: Introduced ABI product flavors for reliable dual release APKs
+  - Flavor dimension "arch" with flavors:
+    - arm64 (arm64-v8a): ships TDLib via :libtd, TG_TDLIB_ENABLED=true
+    - v7a (armeabi-v7a): no TDLib, Telegram disabled with stubs, TG_TDLIB_ENABLED=false
+  - Per-flavor dependency wiring: arm64Implementation(project(":libtd"))
+  - v7a flavor compiles against TdApi sources but uses stub Client/Log without System.loadLibrary
+  - Disabled ABI splits to avoid conflicts with flavor-based ABI selection
+  - Lint no longer aborts builds; META-INF packaging excludes retained
+  - Proguard: keep org.drinkless.tdlib classes to prevent R8 stripping on arm64
+  - Build commands:
+    - ./gradlew :app:assembleArm64Release → arm64 APK with TDLib
+    - ./gradlew :app:assembleV7aRelease   → v7a APK without TDLib

 - TV chrome BACK: On TV, ESC/BACK first collapses HomeChrome (from Expanded or Visible) and consumes the event. Prevents closing the player or leaving the screen while chrome is visible.
 - Tile focus logging: Core row engines now emit detailed focus logs on focus, plus a tree hint. Makes it visible in logcat which concrete tile currently has focus across Start/Library/Details rows.
