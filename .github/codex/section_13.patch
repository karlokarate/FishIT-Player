 # Roadmap
 
+- Priority‑1 (TV UX)
+  - TV Focus/DPAD (ongoing): migrate horizontal containers to TvFocusRow; ensure tvClickable for interactives; audit in CI.
+  - TV Form Kit (v1) — DONE (initial):
+    - ui/forms: TvFormSection, TvTextFieldRow, TvSwitchRow, TvSliderRow, TvSelectRow, TvButtonRow, ValidationHint.
+    - Feature flag BuildConfig.FEATURE_TV_FORMS_V1 (screen‑wise activation).
+    - First integration: PlaylistSetupScreen on TV devices.
+  - TV Form Kit (v2)
+    - Select dialog (option grid), slider long‑press acceleration, numeric picker overlay.
+    - Migrate core Settings options (player choice, cache sizes).
+    - Apply to XtreamPortalCheck (status/controls).
+
+- Near‑term
+  - Continue migrating Settings sections to the Form Kit; add validators and async checks where useful.
+  - Keep AGENTS/Architecture docs in sync after each migration step.
