    Network Security Configuration for FishIT-Player v2
    
    IMPORTANT: Many Xtream Codes providers use HTTP (not HTTPS).
    This configuration allows cleartext traffic to enable connectivity
    with HTTP-only IPTV providers.
    
    Security considerations:
    - Credentials are sent in query parameters (standard Xtream Codes API)
    - Users should be aware their credentials traverse unencrypted connections
    - Provider-side TLS/HTTPS adoption is outside our control
