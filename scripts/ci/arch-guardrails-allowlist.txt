# Architecture Guardrails Allowlist
# 
# This file contains path-based exceptions for the architecture guardrail checks.
# Use this sparingly - each exception must have a clear justification.
#
# Format: <file_path_or_pattern> # TEMP: <reason> - <issue_or_expiry>
#
# Examples:
# app-v2/src/main/java/com/fishit/player/v2/di/TelegramAuthModule.kt # TEMP: DI wiring until #1234 - migrate to infra adapter
# app-v2/src/main/java/com/fishit/player/v2/di/ImagingModule.kt # TEMP until 2026-01-15: Coil integration needs refactor
#
# Rules (Phase A1.4):
# 1. Paths must be relative to repository root
# 2. Supports glob patterns (*, **)
# 3. Lines starting with # are comments
# 4. Empty lines are ignored
# 5. Each allowlist entry MUST contain:
#    - The word "TEMP" (case-insensitive)
#    - Either an issue reference (#123) OR an expiry date (YYYY-MM-DD)
#    - A clear reason explaining why this exception is needed
# 6. Maximum 10 entries allowed (enforced by script)
# 7. Expiry dates in the past will cause CI failure

# App-v2 DI Wiring Exceptions (Phase A1.4)
# ======================================================================
# These files require transport layer access for Hilt dependency injection wiring.
# They act as adapters between transport implementations and domain interfaces.
# TODO: Create proper infra adapter layer to eliminate these exceptions.

app-v2/src/main/java/com/fishit/player/v2/di/TelegramAuthModule.kt # TEMP until 2026-06-01: Binds TelegramAuthClient to feature repositories - needs infra/data-telegram adapter
app-v2/src/main/java/com/fishit/player/v2/di/ImagingModule.kt # TEMP until 2026-06-01: Coil ImageLoader with TelegramThumbFetcher - needs infra/imaging module
app-v2/src/main/java/com/fishit/player/v2/di/TelegramThumbFetcherImpl.kt # TEMP until 2026-06-01: Adapter for Coil Fetcher interface - move to infra/imaging
app-v2/src/main/java/com/fishit/player/v2/XtreamSessionBootstrap.kt # TEMP until 2026-06-01: Bootstrap observing XtreamApiClient - refactor to domain event
app-v2/src/main/java/com/fishit/player/v2/CatalogSyncBootstrap.kt # TEMP until 2026-06-01: Bootstrap observing transport state - refactor to domain event

# ======================================================================
# Growth Cap: Maximum 10 entries allowed
# ======================================================================
# If you need to add more, you must:
# 1. Remove/refactor existing entries first
# 2. Get architecture review approval
# 3. Update this comment with justification
