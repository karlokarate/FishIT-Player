# Project-wide Gradle settings.
# IDE (e.g. Android Studio) users:

# ==============================================================================
# DAEMON SETTINGS
# ==============================================================================
# Enable daemon for local development (disable in Codespace to prevent memory buildup)
org.gradle.daemon=true

# Specifies the JVM arguments used for the daemon process.
# The setting is particularly useful for tweaking memory settings.
# R8 full mode requires 4GB+ heap for large codebases (see android.enableR8.fullMode below)
# NOTE: In Codespace, _JAVA_OPTIONS may override this. Use unset _JAVA_OPTIONS before builds.
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx8g -XX:+UseG1GC -XX:MaxMetaspaceSize=1g -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8

# Enable parallel builds for faster local builds (disable in Codespace)
# For CI with 7GB+ RAM, set to true for faster builds
org.gradle.parallel=true
# Use more workers for faster builds on local machines with 8+ cores
org.gradle.workers.max=4
# Enable Gradle caching
org.gradle.caching=true
# AndroidX package structure to make it clearer which packages are bundled with the
# Android operating system, and which are packaged with your app's APK
# https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/androidx-rn
android.useAndroidX=true
# Kotlin code style for this project: "official" or "obsolete":
kotlin.code.style=official
# Enables namespacing of each library's R class so that its R class includes only the
# resources declared in the library itself and none from the library's dependencies,
# thereby reducing the size of the R class for that library
android.nonTransitiveRClass=true
# Suppress warning about using compileSdk 36 with AGP 8.7.x
android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=36
# Allow configuration cache warnings without failing the build
# DISABLED: ObjectBox incompatibility - see GitHub issue
# org.gradle.configuration-cache.problems=warn

# ==============================================================================
# R8 OPTIMIZATION SETTINGS
# ==============================================================================
# Enable R8 full mode for aggressive code shrinking and optimization
# This enables additional optimizations beyond the default compatibility mode
# IMPORTANT: Requires 4GB+ heap (see org.gradle.jvmargs above)
android.enableR8.fullMode=true

# R8 Java heap (AGP 8.3+): Set explicit memory for R8 tasks
# This ensures R8 has enough heap even when other tasks consume memory
# See: https://developer.android.com/build/shrink-code#troubleshoot
# android.r8.runInSeparateProcess=true  # Not yet supported in AGP 8.8
