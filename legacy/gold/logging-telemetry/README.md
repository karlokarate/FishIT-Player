# Gold: Logging & Telemetry

Curated patterns from the v1 logging and telemetry implementation.

## Key Patterns to Preserve

- **Unified Logging Facade** – Structured logging with domain tags
- **Log Viewer UI** – In-app log inspection for debugging
- **Telemetry Events** – Player stats, pipeline events, performance metrics
- **Diagnostics Logger** – Event-based structured logging
- **Performance Monitor** – Timing and profiling utilities

## Files (to be added)

This folder will contain:
- Annotated logging infrastructure snippets
- Telemetry event schemas
- Log level and filtering strategies
