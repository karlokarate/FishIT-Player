# Gold: Telegram Pipeline

Curated patterns from the v1 Telegram/TDLib integration.

## Key Patterns to Preserve

- **History Scanning** – Efficient chat history traversal with cursor-based paging
- **Lazy Thumbnails** – On-demand thumbnail loading from TDLib file references
- **remoteId Keying** – Stable media identification using TDLib remote file IDs
- **Streaming with Headers** – Range-request handling for media playback
- **Auth Persistence** – Session key storage and re-authentication flows

## Files (to be added)

This folder will contain:
- Annotated code snippets from v1
- Decision records explaining why certain approaches were chosen
- Edge case documentation
