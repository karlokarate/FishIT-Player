# Legacy Gold Nuggets

This folder contains curated "gold nuggets" from the v1 codebase – patterns, implementations, and architectural decisions that are still valuable for v2 development.

## Structure

- **`telegram-pipeline/`** – Telegram/TDLib integration patterns
- **`xtream-pipeline/`** – Xtream Codes API integration patterns
- **`ui-patterns/`** – TV/focus handling and layout patterns
- **`logging-telemetry/`** – Logging and telemetry patterns

## Usage

When working on v2 features, consult these gold nuggets for:
- Proven implementation approaches
- Edge cases already solved in v1
- Patterns that should be preserved (adapted to v2 architecture)

> **Note:** These are reference materials only. Do not copy-paste code directly.
> Always re-implement using v2 architecture (canonical media, normalizer, SIP, etc.).
