# Gold: UI Patterns

Curated patterns from the v1 TV/Android UI implementation.

## Key Patterns to Preserve

- **TV Remote Mapping** – Key event handling, long-press, debouncing
- **Layout Scaffolds** – FishRow, FishTile, DetailScaffold patterns
- **Form Components** – TV-first form inputs (Switch, Slider, TextField, Select)
- **Loading States** – UiState pattern with StatusViews
