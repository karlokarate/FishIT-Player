# Legacy area

Everything under `legacy/` belongs to the old v1 generation or archived code/docs.

- This code and these documents are **not under active development**.
- They serve only as **reference / “gold source”** for the v2 rebuild.
- New features, contracts and implementations happen exclusively outside of `legacy/` in the v2 modules.
